    "text": "Welcome to the world of trees and data!\nI have written extensively on different resources pertaining to working with phylogenetic data and trees on my research website (here). Those interested should check it out and explore the rest of the blog posts there (there are phylogenies).\nHowever for the sake of streamlining this course I will point you to three key resources if you are starting from ground zero or the root of the tree :)\n\n\nIn terms of Books:\n\nLearning From Trees by Luke Harmon. An excellent book on learning the basics and theory in the field of phylogenetic comparative methods.\nPhylogenetic Comparative Methods in R by Liam Revell and Luke Harmon. An amazing R package that is constantly “evolving” and gaining new functions all the time. This package also makes plotting phylogenies wonderful\nThe Phytools Blog by Liam Revell An awesome way to learn more about working with the R package Phytools, in addition to keeping up to date with the new functions and tools\nDecoding Genomes: From Sequences to Phylodynamics by Tanja Stadler, Carsten Magnus, Timothy Vaughan, Joëlle Barido-Sottani, Veronika Bošková, Jana S. Huisman, Jūlija Pečerska. A recent book but from the intro chapters that I have read so far it is very approachable and informative. I love the idea of explaining the whole workflow.\n\n\n\nCourse Structure\nThis course will be structured into 12 weeks each with their own lessons and challenge problems. Each week will build on what was learned in the week prior and add to the level of complexity that you are mastering. There will be assigned book chapters each week and I recommend reading them before beginning the material each week.\nBy the end of the course you should feel comfortable with the following tasks:\n\nLoading phylogenetic data into the R computing environment and plotting it in various formats.\nThe basics of phylogenetic tree inference methods in both a maximum likelihood setting and a bayesian setting.\nUtilizing various methods from the domain of “Phylogenetic Comparative Methods” to answer questions about phenotypic evolution.\nHave some fun figures to show your friends and family.\nA new appreciation for the world around you and how it all fits together."

    "text": "Yours instructor on Appledore Island, where Great Black-Back Gulls and Herring Gulls breed in massive numbers\n\n\nHello there my dear friends and welcome to the world trees and data.\n\nA little about me:\nMy name is Jonathan Dain, and I am a Ph.D. student at UMASS Boston working in the VirusPlusLab led by Dr. Nichola Hill. We are a “Disease Ecology” lab focused on answering questions about the recent avian influenza outbreaks in wild birds. My personal interests lie at the intersection of the host virus dynamic. What are the ecological and phylogenetic drivers of avian influenza in the current North American outbreak? What can we learn from the host about infection with this virus in terms of the disease phenotype and immune response? What can we learn from the viral genomes about spread of the virus, host factors affecting spread and much more? Why do some bird species get infected with the virus and die very quickly while others are asymptomatic? How much does the host gene expression impact the spread of this virus into new areas and populations? If you are interested in more of my research check our my academic website here.\n\n\nIn this course:\nProbaly of more interest to you is this course, well let’s get started. The foremost goal of this course is to give you the skills necessary to be a life long learner of phylogenetics both inside and outside the R computational environment. In this course we will explore the following topics:\n\nThe structure and format of phylogenetic trees.\nHow to reconstruct phylogenetic trees using both maximum likelihood and bayesian frameworks.\nThe analysis of phenotypic data along our phylogeny using various models of phenotypic evolution.\nHow to create some beautiful paper ready phylograms.\nThe core concepts and methods of phylodynamics."
